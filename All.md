### **Text Preprocessing Explained Simply**  

#### **1. Why Preprocess Text?**  
Raw text is messy (e.g., "I LOVEEEE NLP!!!"). Preprocessing cleans it for analysis, improving tasks like sentiment analysis or machine translation.  

#### **2. Key Steps**:  
- **Tokenization**: Split text into words/sentences (e.g., "Hello, world!" → ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"]).  
- **Noise Removal**:  
  - Delete stop words ("the", "is") and punctuation unless needed.  
  - Handle case sensitivity ("NLP" vs. "nlp").  
- **Normalization**:  
  - Lowercase everything ("HeLLo" → "hello").  
  - Fix contractions ("can't" → "cannot").  
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**:  
  - **Stemming**: Fast but rough ("running" → "run").  
  - **Lemmatization**: Accurate but slow ("better" → "good").  

#### **3. Advanced Techniques**:  
- **Subword Tokenization** (e.g., BPE in GPT): Splits rare words into parts ("unhappiness" → "un", "happiness").  
- **Statistical Methods**: Use ML to split text (e.g., for languages like Chinese).  

#### **4. Challenges**:  
- Ambiguity: "New York-based" → 1 or 2 tokens?  
- Languages: Some lack spaces (e.g., Japanese).  

#### **5. Real-World Use**:  
Preprocessing is key for chatbots, search engines, and analyzing social media.  

**Pro Tip**: Always adapt steps to your goal (e.g., keep "$1.34" for financial analysis).

### **Text Representation Explained Simply**  

#### **1. Why Represent Text?**  
Computers don’t understand words—they need numbers! Text representation converts words into numerical formats for analysis (e.g., spam detection, search engines).  

#### **2. Traditional Methods**  
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**:  
  - Counts word frequencies in a document. Ignores order.  
  - *Example*: "I love NLP. I love data." → {"I":2, "love":2, "NLP":1, "data":1}.  
  - **Limitation**: Misses context (e.g., "not love" vs. "love").  

- **TF-IDF**:  
  - Weights words by importance:  
    - **Term Frequency (TF)**: How often a word appears in a document.  
    - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Penalizes common words (e.g., "the").  
  - *Example*: In a doc about cats, "meow" has high TF-IDF; "the" has low TF-IDF.  

- **N-Grams**:  
  - Captures word sequences (e.g., bigrams: "New York", trigrams: "I love you").  
  - *Use Case*: Predict next word in "bread and ___" (→ "butter").  

#### **3. Challenges**  
- **Ambiguity**: Same word = different meanings ("bank" → river or money?).  
- **Word Order**: BoW ignores it ("dog bites man" ≠ "man bites dog").  
- **Rare Words**: Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words break models.  

#### **4. Advanced: Probability & Smoothing**  
- **N-Gram Probabilities**: Predict words using previous words (e.g., *P("food" | "Chinese")*).  
- **Smoothing**: Fixes zero-probability issues for unseen words:  
  - **Laplace (Add-1)**: Add 1 to all counts. Simple but biased.  
  - **Add-k**: Add a fraction (e.g., 0.5) for finer control.  

#### **5. Key Takeaways**  
- **BoW/TF-IDF**: Good for simple tasks (document classification).  
- **N-Grams**: Better for context (speech recognition).  
- **Modern Methods** (not covered here): Word2Vec, BERT (capture deeper semantics).  

**Pro Tip**: Choose the method based on your goal—speed (BoW) vs. accuracy (embeddings).

### **Text Similarity and Clustering Explained Simply**  

#### **1. Why Measure Text Similarity?**  
- Computers need numbers to compare texts (e.g., detect plagiarism, recommend articles).  
- **Goal**: Group similar documents (clustering) or rank them by relevance (search engines).  

#### **2. Text Representation for Similarity**  
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Counts word frequencies (ignores order).  
- **TF-IDF**: Weights words by importance (frequent in doc, rare in corpus).  
- **Word Embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec): Captures semantic meaning (e.g., "king" – "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen").  
- **Contextual Embeddings** (e.g., BERT): Understands word context ("bank" as financial vs. river).  

#### **3. Similarity Metrics**  
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors (best for text; ignores magnitude).  
  - *Example*: Doc1 = "cat dog", Doc2 = "dog lion" → high similarity.  
- **Euclidean Distance**: Straight-line distance between vectors (sensitive to magnitude).  
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Compares word overlap (e.g., {"cat", "dog"} vs. {"dog", "lion"} → 0.5 similarity).  

#### **4. Clustering Techniques**  
- **K-Means**: Groups texts into *k* clusters:  
  1. Randomly pick *k* centers.  
  2. Assign each doc to the nearest center.  
  3. Update centers based on assigned docs.  
  4. Repeat until stable.  
- **Choosing *k***: Use the **Elbow Method** (pick *k* where WSS stops improving sharply).  

#### **5. Evaluation**  
- **Inertia**: Sum of squared distances to cluster centers (lower = tighter clusters).  
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a doc is to its cluster vs. others (higher = better).  

#### **6. Applications**  
- **Search Engines**: Rank pages by cosine similarity to query.  
- **News Aggregation**: Cluster similar articles.  
- **Chatbots**: Match user queries to predefined intents.  

---  
**Pro Tip**: Use TF-IDF for simple tasks; embeddings for nuanced semantics (e.g., "happy" vs. "joyful").

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals: POS Tagging**  

### **Introduction**  
POS tagging assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb) to words in a sentence, resolving ambiguity. For example:  
- *"back"* can be a noun (*"the back"*), verb (*"back the bill"*), or adverb (*"go back"*).  

---

### **Key Concepts**  
1. **Universal POS Tags**:  
   - Basic categories like `NOUN` (cat), `VERB` (run), `ADJ` (happy).  

2. **Penn Treebank Tags**:  
   - Fine-grained tags (e.g., `NNP` for proper nouns, `VBD` for past tense verbs).  

3. **Ambiguity**:  
   - Many words have multiple tags (e.g., 55% of words in corpora are ambiguous).  

---

### **Methods for POS Tagging**  
1. **Rule-Based**:  
   - Uses handcrafted rules (e.g., words ending in *"-ing"* are verbs).  

2. **Statistical (HMMs)**:  
   - **Hidden Markov Models** predict tags using:  
     - **Transition Probabilities**: Likelihood of tag sequences.  
     - **Emission Probabilities**: Likelihood of words given tags.  
   - **Viterbi Algorithm**: Finds the most probable tag sequence.  

3. **Neural Networks**:  
   - Advanced models like LSTMs or Transformers learn patterns from data.  

---

### **Example**  
- *"The cat sleeps"* → Tagged as `DET NOUN VERB`.  

### **Why It Matters**  
POS tagging is crucial for NLP tasks like parsing, translation, and sentiment analysis.

  - **Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1**: Measure classifier performance.  
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true vs. predicted labels.  
- **Statistical Significance**:  
  - **Bootstrapping**: Tests if model improvements are real or random.  

---

### **5. Example: Sentiment Analysis**  
- **Input**: *"The movie was great!"* → **Label**: Positive.  
- **Challenge**: Negation (e.g., *"not great"* flips sentiment).  

---

### **6. Why It Matters**

- **Always**: Preprocess data, choose the right architecture, and monitor training/validation performance. 

---  
### **Word Senses & WordNet**
- **Word Sense**: Discrete meaning aspect of a word (e.g., "bass" as fish vs. musical instrument).  
- **WordNet**: Lexical database organizing senses via:  
  - **Synonymy** (similar meaning)  
  - **Hyponymy** (IS-A hierarchy, e.g., "bass guitar" → "guitar" → "instrument")  
  - **Meronymy** (part-whole, e.g., "wheel" → "car")  

**Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**:  
- **Algorithms**:  
  1. **Contextual Embeddings**: Average embeddings of sense examples (e.g., GloVe) to match test word embeddings.  
  2. **Lesk Algorithm**: Compare overlap between word’s dictionary definition (gloss) and sentence context.  
  3. **Feature-Based**: Use POS tags, collocations (n-grams), and embeddings in classifiers (e.g., SVM).  

**Evaluation**:

#### **1. Relation Extraction**  
- **Supervised Learning**:  
  - **Features**: Entity types (PER/ORG), word embeddings, syntactic paths (e.g., dependency trees).  
  - **Example**: "United (ORG) is a unit of UAL (ORG)" → `Part-Whole-Subsidiary` relation.  
- **Semi-Supervised (Bootstrapping)**:  
  - Start with seed tuples (e.g., 〈Apple, founded_by, Steve Jobs〉).  
  - Generalize patterns (e.g., "X, founded by Y") to extract new tuples.  
- **Unsupervised (Open IE)**:  
  - Extract verb-based relations (e.g., "X acquired Y") using syntactic constraints (e.g., ReVerb).  

**Evaluation**:  
- **Precision**: Correct extractions / Total extractions.  

#### **2. Temporal Extraction**  
- **Tags**: IOB labels (e.g., "last week" → `B-TIME I-TIME`).  
- **Features**: Lexical triggers ("Monday"), POS tags, character shapes.  
- **Normalization**: Map phrases to ISO formats (e.g., "April 24, 1916" → `1916-04-24`).  

#### **3. Event Extraction**  
- **Features**:  
  - Verb roots ("increased" → "increase").  
  - Nominalizations ("acquisition" → "acquire").
